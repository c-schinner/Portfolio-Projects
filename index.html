          <h1>Chris Schinner</h1>
            <p>This is my bio. My name is Chris Schinner. I am a self-taught Python Developer, who has spent the last 2 years 
            learing every skill I can to achieve my goals of becoming a software developer.<br>
            I have earned certifications from Codecademy, DataCamp, and SoloLearn.<br>
            I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to become a full-stack developer.<br>
            This project is going to help showcase some of the skills I have learned.

        <div id="about me">
            <h3>About Me:</h3>
              <p>My entire life I have always been a challenge seeker, always asking questions and wanting to know how things can be done effeciently.<br>
                I have a passion for testing my limits and pushing boundaries.<br>
                I used to be a mixed martial arts fighter, competing in amature MMA fights, as well as taking boxing, kickboxing, jiu-jitsu, and Muay Thai.<br>
                The skills I have learned from these sports reflect how I think and process a problem and how I can solve it.<br>
                Another great passion I have is chess. I enjoy every aspect of the game, which takes such strong mental toughness and 
                challenges you constantly. It really translates into the real world with working through tough decisions and always thinking ahead.
