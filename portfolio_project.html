            <h3>About Me:</h3>
              <p>My entire life I have always been a challenge seeker, always asking questions and wanting to know how things can be done effeciently.<br>
                I have a passion for testing my limits and pushing boundaries.<br>
                I used to be a mixed martial arts fighter, competing in amature MMA fights, as well as taking boxing, kickboxing, jiu-jitsu, and Muay Thai.<br>
                The skills I have learned from these sports reflect how I think and process a problem and how I can solve it.<br>
