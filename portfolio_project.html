            <p>This is my bio. My name is Chris Schinner. I am a self-taught Python Developer, who has spent the last 2 years 
            learing every skill I can to achieve my goals of becoming a software developer.<br>
            I have earned certifications from Codecademy, DataCamp, and SoloLearn.<br>
            I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to become a full-stack developer.<br>
            This project is going to help showcase some of the skills I have learned.

            <h3>About Me:</h3>
              <p>My entire life I have always been a challenge seeker, always asking questions and wanting to know how things can be done effeciently.<br>
                I have a passion for testing my limits and pushing boundaries.<br>
